​​## Introduction:

This Jupyter Notebook aims to analyze and compare different neighborhoods in Pittsburgh based on three main datasets: arrest_data.csv, education_data.csv, and tree_data.csv. The analysis considers three major factors that contribute to a safe and nurturing environment for raising a family: safety, education, and green spaces. By evaluating and ranking the neighborhoods according to these factors, we can identify the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh for raising a family.

The Metric(s): The analysis in the Jupyter Notebook relies on a combination of metrics related to safety, education, and green spaces to evaluate the neighborhoods. These metrics include

1. Arrest Data Information
2. Education Data Information
3. Green Spaces Information

## Data Evaluation ⇒

Arrest Data Analysis:
The arrest_data.csv file contains information about arrests made in various neighborhoods across Pittsburgh. This dataset allows us to assess the safety of a neighborhood by calculating the number of arrests made, types of crimes committed, and crime rates. A lower crime rate and fewer arrests indicate a safer environment for children to grow up in.

To analyze this data, we will first clean and preprocess the dataset to remove any irrelevant information or outliers. Next, we will compute the total number of arrests per neighborhood, as well as the arrest rate (arrests per 1,000 residents). Finally, we will rank the neighborhoods based on these safety metrics and visualize the results.

Education Data Analysis:
The education_data.csv file includes demographic data and educational attainment levels of residents in each Pittsburgh neighborhood. Analyzing this data helps determine the quality of schools and educational resources available for children, as well as the overall educational environment in a neighborhood.

We will first preprocess and clean the dataset. After that, we will compute the percentage of residents with a high school diploma or higher and the percentage of residents with a bachelor's degree or higher for each neighborhood. We will then rank the neighborhoods based on these educational metrics and visualize the results.

## Tree Data Analysis (green spaces)

The tree_data.csv file contains information about the number of trees and green spaces present in each neighborhood. Access to green spaces and parks is crucial for children's physical and mental well-being, as they provide a space for outdoor activities, social interaction, and relaxation.

We will first preprocess and clean the dataset. Then, we will compute the total number of trees per neighborhood and the tree density (trees per square mile) for each neighborhood. We will rank the neighborhoods based on these green space metrics and visualize the results.

## Evaluation Reflection:

After analyzing and ranking the neighborhoods based on safety, education, and green spaces, we will combine the results to create a comprehensive ranking of the best neighborhoods for raising a family in Pittsburgh. This ranking will take into consideration the importance of each factor, and we will visualize the final results to provide a clear representation of the top neighborhoods for families.

This Jupyter Notebook provides a data-driven approach to finding the perfect neighborhood in Pittsburgh for raising a family. By analyzing and ranking the neighborhoods based on safety, education, and green spaces, we can identify the areas that offer the best environment for children to grow and thrive. This analysis will serve as a valuable resource for families looking to relocate or settle down in Pittsburgh.

So, what is the best Neighborhood?
